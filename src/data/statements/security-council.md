# Security Council: International Terrorism and Border Security

## Background
International terrorism continues to pose significant threats to global security in the 21st century. As terrorist organizations evolve their tactics and utilize modern technology, nations face unprecedented challenges in securing their borders while maintaining the flow of legitimate travel and commerce.

## Key Issues
- The transnational nature of modern terrorist networks
- The use of digital platforms for recruitment and radicalization
- Balancing security measures with human rights and civil liberties
- Coordination challenges between intelligence agencies across borders
- The impact of refugee crises on border security protocols

## Questions to Consider
1. How can member states improve information sharing while protecting sensitive intelligence?
2. What technological solutions can enhance border security without impeding legitimate movement?
3. How should the international community address the root causes of terrorism?
4. What role should non-governmental organizations play in counter-terrorism efforts?
