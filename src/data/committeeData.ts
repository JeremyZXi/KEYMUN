        chair: "To be determined",
        coChair: "Sidu Chen ‘29",
        statementOfProblem: `Proliferation of armed drones in the Middle East have reshaped global understanding and usage of airpower, exposed multiple ethical implications about the projection of power through drone strikes, and further increased the impact of conflict on civilians. The Royal United Services Institute has seen rapid increase in both domestic production as well as reliance on external suppliers of armed drones. However, on this issue, international discussion has remained extremely limited; global norms have yet to be determined fully. International meetings have not produced a result on addressing the proliferation of armed drones in the Middle East yet, and opinions of major powers differ. 
In this committee, delegates should discuss international norms and guidelines for the usage of armed drones in the Middle East, focusing on the trend of increasing military use of armed drones and the impact this may bring upon both conflict in the Middle East itself and civilians affected by conflict.

        topic: "Ethical Implications of Measures in Counterterrorism from Post 9/11 to Present Day ",
        chair: "Rachel Lin ‘27",
        coChair: "To be determined",
        statementOfProblem: `After the attacks that happened on September 11, 2001 in the United State, nations across the globe have intensified counterterrorism focus in order to protect national security. Policies that were implemented as a result include the USA PATRIOT Act, mass surveillance programs, drone strikes, and indefinite detention. Currently, there is a large range of counterterrorism measures, including physical and digital surveillance, terrorist lists and sanctions, targeted killings, and enhanced interrogation techniques. However, these measures have raised serious ethical concerns regarding human rights and privacy. More specifically, they are disproportionately impacting the marginalized, restricting civil liberties, and undermining human rights, such as the right to privacy, fair due process, and to be free from torture. 
In the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia, drone warfare and military interventions have caused civilian casualties and worsened radicalization. Even more so, counterterrorism operations often lack transparency and accountability, resulting in far too many cases of abuse of power and violations of international law. As terrorism prevails, the international community must ensure that security does not come at the expense of fundamental human rights. 
SOCHUM must address how the international community can balance the legitimate need of counterterrorism measures for national security with its ethical implications. In this committee, delegates will research and argue the extent governments should be able to monitor and control the digital platform, the appropriate range of these measures before they start to threaten human rights, whether these practices are protection or oppression, if these actions can be justified in the name of national and international security and whether they break international humanitarian law, and if governments should be held accountable for past and present actions and stances.

        coChair: "Yoyo Lv ‘27",
        statementOfProblem: `The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted international trade, revealing weaknesses in supply chains, protectionist measures, and economic disparities. They need to manage obstacles like trade barriers, logistical issues, and changing demand while seizing opportunities such as digital trade, regional collaboration, and sustainable business practices. 
Delegates should examine strategies to strengthen trade resilience, minimize obstacles, and encourage inclusive growth. This could involve enhancing multilateral trade agreements, promoting green and digital trade efforts, and guaranteeing fair distribution of vaccines and medical supplies.
